This repository contains mainly Jupyter notebooks scripts to be used for the analysis of the JF4p5 images and BS data.

Files:

1) XES_scans_analysis_Febpy_Oct18.ipynb		script for JF4p5 data, single files or for looping over scan data
						Version from November 2018, after Febpy commissioning beamtime -- p17589


2) BS_analysis.ipynb				script for BS data, for looping over scan data.
						Version from November 2018, after Febpy commissioning beamtime -- p17589


3) alvra_exp-Copy5.ipynb			script for JF4p5 data.
						This is an old file which was the basis for developing the XES_scans_analysis file

4) YAG_pumpprobe_BS.ipynb                       script for analyzing the YAG data (FEL pump, laser probe).
						In this script the laser runs at double rate than the FEL (50 vs 25 Hz for instance).
						The script is very similar to BS_analysis, but better create another one with the proper assignment of FEL on/off shots
